Couple of big news points from the team to you.

### 1. We're in Full Time

As of last month both I (Michael) and co-founder Masae has gone full time into Culturestride! We're now 100% committed to helping you learn language better and become more globally opportunistic. With more time comes more projects, so expect to see more developments and even greater speed of development for our company 🙂.

### 2. New Team Member

We had a new team member who's joined the team to support our growth! Welcome <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-rong/" target="_blank">Ethan Rong</a> who will be helping out in growth and product development.

### 3. Culturestride Universe

When I was actively learning Chinese, I always struggled to find great TV shows and movies that I could watch to help me bring up my listening and reading skills. I would rely on recommendations from Chinese friends that I'd hurriedly jot down and would never really be looked up afterwards (sorry!).

So we launched <a href="https://culturestride.com/universe" target="_blank">Culturestride Universe</a>.

Culturestride Universe is a community-driven repo of the best of Chinese entertainment and pop culture for students and anyone interested in immersing themselves deeper into Chinese culture.

We started with movies, TV Shows and anime as a pilot but we'd love to hear your suggestions on what you'd like to see next.

Find links to <a href="https://culturestride.com/universe/movies" target="_blank">Chinese movies</a> such as:

- Wandering Earth 流浪地球 (English subtitles available)
- Red Cliff 赤壁
- Ip Man 4 叶问四 (English subtitles available)
- L for Love L for Lies 我的最爱
