The second I landed in China on 20 Feb 2019 I realised I'd been living in a bubble.

With almost a different-everything - it came as a huge culture shock to see a society that was so culturally and ideologically different from home.
Whilst gorging on cheap dumplings, I saw how different political systems changed society and how human values, government influence, education are malleable concepts, unique to every single part of the world.

And by exploring another culture, I was able to analyse my own and it was an amazingly eyeopening experience in grooming me to think way more global. The world is globalising faster than ever and with it comes amazing opportunities for individuals like you and me.

I'm hoping to build something big to help others have this same experience and help them position themselves better for the internationalising future.

### Culturestride is on a mission to create global citizens.

Rocket Internet's Mads Faurholt-Jørgensen articulates this idea well in his TEDx talk "Why Shouldn't I Solve It?"

We believe the first step of this journey starts with language so this is our first product.

## Culturestride Language

We believe it's hard pressed to know a culture if you don't speak the native tongue.

We pair you up with certified, native and personally interviewed language teachers from and living in that country to breakdown the linguistic and cultural barrier between you and the culture.

We offer 1:1 online courses taught flexibly to your schedule to bring you from whatever proficiency you are at to at least conversationally fluent - with an emphasis on learning only what is useful in everyday communication. Each lesson is 1.5 to 2 hours of your time, typically twice a week.

We charge fixed fee to get you to your proficiency goal so that there's no risk of teachers "dragging lessons out" to get more money out of you.
Currently we only offer Mandarin Chinese but, please fill in this <a href="https://culturestride.typeform.com/to/VNXeTO" target="_blank">form</a> if you'd like to see other languages.

Learning language is difficult and time consuming but we believe the opportunities that it opens up for any individual are well worth the time.
