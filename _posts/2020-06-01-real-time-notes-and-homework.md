Version 1 of real time teaching notes and homework submission tool for Culturestride students is live now!

We felt that the manual Word Docs that were being passed back and forth between students and teachers in the online language learning process could be modernised with a Google-doc like real time collaborative experience within our platform.

We didn't find anything out there that would work for our purposes so we built it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Real time collaborative class notes and homework lets students and teachers share new words, class content and miscellaneous notes real lesson time and gives students an open platform to submit and have their homework reviewed and corrected in a one place.

Students can now learn and retain their new learnt language better with a centralised and up to date repository of all their lesson notes and previous homework submissions.
