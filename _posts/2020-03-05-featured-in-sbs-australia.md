#### Translated Description in English:

UNSW Graduate Michael Liang released an online Chinese learning platform called [Culturestride](https://culturestride.com), to help Australian students learn Chinese from Chinese native teachers.

When mentioning his own study experience, Michael said "when I was in high school studying Chinese, I realised that accessibility to Chinese teachers was difficult to come by."

"Part of the reason it sometimes felt difficult to master Chinese was because teachers weren't typically Chinese natives. My teacher was Singaporean where Chinese is typically used as a second langauge."

Following the growth of China's importance to Australia's economy, international trade and the China-America trade agreement, more and more people are interested in learning Chinese.

Whilst living in Shanghai for a period of time, Michael saw a market opportunity. Reflecting on his own Chinese experience, he created an online learning platform with the hope of helping other Australians learn Chinese. His platform can allow students to learn directly from Chinese teachers situated in China.

Michael told [SBS Mandarin](https://www.sbs.com.au/language/mandarin), lots of his friends and colleagues want to learn Chinese but finding certified Chinese teachers is relatively expensive. After living in Shanghai for a period of time, he decided to use his own experience and everything he's learnt to help people learn Chinese better.

He said, the difference between this platform is the way students pay, his platform lets students master Chinese better by charging according to standardised [Chinese HSK levels](https://culturestride.com/hsk), this way students learn in a more relaxed environment with better results.

#### Original Description in Chinese:

毕业于新南威尔士大学商学院的Michael Liang推出了一个在线视频中文学习平台Culturestride，使澳大利亚的学生可以向中国的中文教师学习中文。

提到自己的学习经历，Michael说：“当我在高中学习中文时，我感到在澳大利亚缺少优秀的中文老师。”

“我无法很好地掌握所学的中文，部分原因是老师不是中文母语人士。我的老师是新加坡人，中文也是她的第二语言。”

随着中国在澳大利亚经济中的重要性与日俱增，从跨境贸易到最近与美国的贸易协定，越来越多的人对学习中文感兴趣。

在上海生活了一段时间后，Michael看到了市场机遇。他根据自己的中文学习经历，创建了一个学中文的在线视频平台，希望能帮助澳洲本土学习中文的人。他所创建的平台可以让学生向身在中国的职业中文教师学习中文。

Michael告诉SBS普通话节目，他的同学和朋友中有很想学中文的，但在本地找专业的中文老师比较昂贵，在中国的上海市学习生活了一段时间后，他决定用自己的经验和所学来帮助这个人群学习中文。

他说， 不同于按时计费的教学模式，他所设计的在线学习平台以掌握中文的程度为标准进行收费，这样可以让学生学习起来更放松，效果更好。
