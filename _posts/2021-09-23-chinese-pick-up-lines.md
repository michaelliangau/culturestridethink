Chinese people are no foreigner to 土味情话 (pickup lines) with this tonal language offering some incredible opportunities for wordplay. Try these out in your next conversation with your current (or soon to be...) loved one.

1. **你今天特别讨厌，讨人喜欢和百看不厌**  
    Pinyin: nǐ jīn tiān tè bié tǎo yàn, tǎo rén xǐ huān hé bǎi kàn bù yàn  
    Literal translation: Today you're especially annoying, making people like you and nor tire of you.

    This is a wordplay on 讨厌 (hate/annoying) being split up into its components 讨 and 厌. In this context, 讨人喜欢 means 'to attract affection' and 百看不厌 means literally 'to look a hundred times and still not tire'. From the first sentence, it sounds like you're annoyed at the person but suddenly they're hit with not one but two compliments. Smooth.

2. **你会弹吉他吗？为什么拨动了我的心弦**  
    Pinyin: nǐ huì tán jí tā má？ wéi shén me bō dòng liǎo wǒ de xīn xián  
    Literal translation: Can you play the guitar? (Because) why have my heartstrings been plucked.

3. **"我在找一匹马" "什么马?" "你的手机号码."**  
    Pinyin: "wǒ zài zhǎo yī pǐ mǎ" "shén me mǎ?" "nǐ de shǒu jī hào mǎ."  
    Literal translation: "I'm looking for a horse?" "What type of horse?" "Your phone number."

    马 (horse) and 码 are both phoenetically pronounced ma so this is a play on words to refer to 手机号码 as a type of 马. You can replace phone with any 号码 (e.g. WeChat number 微信号码). 

4. **"你知道我的缺点是什么吗？" "是什么？" "缺点你."**  
    Pinyin: nǐ zhī dào wǒ de quē diǎn shì shén me má？shì shén me? quē diǎn nǐ.  
    Literal translation: "Do you know what my weakness is?" "What is it?" "I lack you."

    A play on 缺点 (weakness) to later use 缺 as a verb to mean 'to lack' and 点 to mean 'a little'. 

5. **你闻到空气中有烧焦的味道吗？那是我的心在为你燃烧**  
    Pinyin: nǐ wén dào kōng qì zhōng yǒu shāo jiāo de wèi dào má？nà shì wǒ de xīn zài wéi nǐ rán shāo  
    Literal translation: Do you smell the burning in the air? It's my heart burning for you.

6. **我以前喜欢吃肉，但今天看到你我决定开始吃素，因为，你是我的菜。**  
    Pinyin: wǒ yǐ qián xǐ huān chī ròu，dàn jīn tiān kàn dào nǐ wǒ jué dìng kāi shǐ chī sù，yīn wéi，nǐ shì wǒ de cài。  
    Literal translation: I used to like to eat meat, but after seeing you today I've decided to become a vegetarian. Because you're my vegetable.

    Probably the best example of Chinese not translating well into English. Although 菜 literally means "vegetable" or "food", in this context, it's closer to 'you're my snack'. 

7. **你有打火机吗？没有啊，那你是怎么点燃我的心的？**  
    Pinyin: nǐ yǒu dǎ huǒ jī má？méi yǒu ā，nà nǐ shì zěn me diǎn rán wǒ de xīn de ？  
    Literal translation: "Do you have a lighter?" "No" "Then how did you light my heart on fire?"

    Burning with desire, you love to see it. 

8. **你知道我的心在哪边么？左边啊不，在你那边**  
    Pinyin: nǐ zhī dào wǒ de xīn zài nǎ biān me？zuǒ biān ā bù，zài nǐ nà biān  
    Literal translation: Do you which side my heart is? Not on the left side, by your side.

9. **"你猜我什么星座?" "双鱼座？" "错，为你量身定做。"**  
    Pinyin: "nǐ cāi wǒ shén me xīng zuò? "shuāng yú zuò?" "cuò，wéi nǐ liáng shēn dìng zuò"  
    Literal translation: "Can you guess my zodiac sign?" "Pisces?" "Wrong, tailor made to you."

    Because the 座 in 星座 (zodiac sign) is similar to 做 (phoenetically 'zuo'), it's a play on 量身定做 (tailor made) being a type of Zodiac sign.
