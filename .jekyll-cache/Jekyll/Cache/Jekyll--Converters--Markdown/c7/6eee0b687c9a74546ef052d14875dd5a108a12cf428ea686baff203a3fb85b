I"å<p>When you can finally speak your parentâ€™s language (culturally and literally) a pandoraâ€™s box of empathy opens up towards them.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s the realisation that I came to when I started learning Chinese and living in China last year.</p>

<p>My name is Michael Liang, 2019 UNSW B Commerce/Information Systems Grad. In 2019, I moved to Shanghai to study and learn Chinese. mostly driven by cultural curiosity.</p>

<p>Like a lot of language learners, I did it for business purposes but once I got started it quickly turned into a journey of discovery about family and culture that I had no idea what I was getting into.</p>

<p>I love my parents to bits but, like a lot of Chinese Australians, culturally we disagreed on many levels about almost everything. They were always â€œso Chineseâ€.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think people question this dynamic enough but Iâ€™d love to share with you my journey and how that brought me towards creating <a href="https://culturestride.com">Culturestride</a> to help other culturally curious Australians learn Chinese language and culture.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to share with you the journey I went through in 2019 and the parent-child dynamic shifts as Chinese proficiency improved.</p>

<h3 id="2-months-into-chinese">2 months into Chinese</h3>

<p>I started from HSK 2 (starting to be able to string together sentences) and in 2 months, I hit HSK 3 (comfortably creating sentences).</p>

<p>My relationship with my Mum historically is loving but less â€œhow was your dayâ€ type. She engages and corrects and laughs at me when I screw things up.</p>

<p><br />
For the first time ever, I was joking with my parents.</p>

<h3 id="4-months-into-chinese">4 months into Chinese</h3>

<p>Finished HSK 3, started learning HSK 4 (conversational).</p>

<p>I can chat to them in Chinese, tell them about my day and where Iâ€™ve been travelling to. When we video call, Iâ€™d try to talk to them only in Mandarin but often would fail and get roasted about how trash my language was.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><i>*She says â€œlooks so pretty! Donâ€™t forget to sleep early and be carefulâ€!*</i></div>
<p><br />
My maternal grandmother who raised me is the first to know about my Lao girlfriend via text. I tell her to not tell my parents in case they donâ€™t approve ğŸ˜‚.
Previously I typically only connect with her at family gatherings.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><i>*Sheâ€™s the one on the right*</i></div>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="1-year-into-chinese">1 Year into Chinese</h3>

<p>Finished HSK 4, studying HSK 5 (business level)</p>

<p>A lot less is lost in translation and for me, my parents have become more human.</p>

<p>Our family WeChat chat is no longer an exercise in Google Translate but actually accessible. I keep in touch every day with whatâ€™s happening with my grandparents and extended family.
Things that I just accepted about Chinese culture start to reveal themselves as I learnt more about China. For example, I never got why Chinese people focus so highly on education until I understood gaokao é«˜è€ƒ (Chinaâ€™s university entrance exam).</p>

<p>In Chinese society, your university determines a lot of your place in society and business opportunity.</p>

<p>For jobs, certain companies wonâ€™t even consider you if you didnâ€™t go to the top 5 universities (Tsinghua, Fudan, Peking, Jiaotong or Zhejiang University).</p>

<p>And from society and people, you are viewed with pearly eyes if you went to one of these universities â€” ego boost.</p>

<p>With university entrance being guided entirely by your performance in this single exam (100% weighted), it flows why my parents wanted me to do tutoring to kill the HSC.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is still an ongoing journey and Iâ€™ll continue to learn more and more as I spend more time interacting with Chinese society and culture. Iâ€™m nowhere near fully literate linguistically or culturally but the hope is weâ€™ll get there one day.</p>

<p>For culturally curious Australians, Iâ€™ve set up some infrastructure to help you go on this journey without moving to China with an online language school â€” <a href="https://culturestride.com">Culturestride</a>.
