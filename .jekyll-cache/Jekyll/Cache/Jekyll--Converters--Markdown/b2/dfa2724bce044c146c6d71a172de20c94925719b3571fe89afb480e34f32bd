I"}<p>The second I landed in China on 20 Feb 2019 I realised I’d been living in a bubble.</p>

<p>With almost a different-everything,  it came as a huge culture shock to see a society that was so culturally and ideologically different from home.</p>

<p>Whilst gorging on dumplings, I saw how different political systems changed society and how human values, government influence, education are malleable concepts, unique to every single part of the world.</p>

<p>The experience taught me to think globally and with the world internationalising faster than ever before and I believe it creates amazing opportunities for individuals like you and me.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to build <a href="https://culturestride.com">Culturestride</a> to help others have this same experience and position themselves better for the internationalising future.</p>

<p>Rocket Internet’s Mads Faurholt-Jørgensen articulates this idea well in his TEDx talk “Why Shouldn’t I Solve It?”</p>

<p>We believe the first step of this journey starts with language so this is our first product.</p>

<h2 id="culturestride-language">Culturestride Language</h2>

<p>We believe it’s hard pressed to know a culture if you don’t speak the native tongue.</p>

<p>So we pair you up with certified, native and personally interviewed language teachers from and living in that country to breakdown the linguistic and cultural barrier between you and the culture.</p>

<p>We offer 1:1 online courses taught flexibly to your schedule to bring you from whatever proficiency you are at to at least conversationally fluent - with an emphasis on learning only what is useful in everyday communication. Each lesson is 1.5 to 2 hours of your time, typically twice a week.</p>

<p>To get you to your proficiency goal with no risk of teachers “dragging lessons out”, we charge fixed fee. Although we currently only offer Mandarin Chinese in Culturestride Language, please let us know <a href="https://culturestride.typeform.com/to/VNXeTO" target="_blank">here</a> if you’d like to see other languages.</p>

<p>Learning language is difficult and time consuming but we believe the opportunities that it opens up for any individual are well worth the investment.</p>
