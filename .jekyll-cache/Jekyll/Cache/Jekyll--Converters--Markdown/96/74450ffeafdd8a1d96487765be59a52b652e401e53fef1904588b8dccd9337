<p>UNSW Graduate Michael Liang released an online Chinese learning platform called <a href="https://culturestride.com">Culturestride</a>, to help Australian students learn Chinese from Chinese native teachers.</p>

<p>When mentioning his own study experience, Michael said â€œwhen I was in high school studying Chinese, I realised that accessibility to Chinese teachers was difficult to come by.â€</p>

<p>â€œPart of the reason it sometimes felt difficult to master Chinese was because teachers werenâ€™t typically Chinese natives. My teacher was Singaporean where Chinese is typically used as a second langauge.â€</p>

<p>Following the growth of Chinaâ€™s importance to Australiaâ€™s economy, international trade and the China-America trade agreement, more and more people are interested in learning Chinese.</p>

<p>Whilst living in Shanghai for a period of time, Michael saw a market opportunity. Reflecting on his own Chinese experience, he created an online learning platform with the hope of helping other Australians learn Chinese. His platform can allow students to learn directly from Chinese teachers situated in China.</p>

<p>Michael told <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/language/mandarin">SBS Mandarin</a>, lots of his friends and colleagues want to learn Chinese but finding certified Chinese teachers is relatively expensive. After living in Shanghai for a period of time, he decided to use his own experience and everything heâ€™s learnt to help people learn Chinese better.</p>

<p>He said, the difference between this platform is the way students pay, his platform lets students master Chinese better by charging according to standardised <a href="https://culturestride.com/hsk">Chinese HSK levels</a>, this way students learn in a more relaxed environment with better results.</p>
