<p>Couple of big news points from the team to you.</p>

<h3 id="2-new-team-member">2. New Team Member</h3>

<p>We had a new team member who’s joined the team to support our growth! Welcome <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-rong/" target="_blank">Ethan Rong</a> who will be helping out in growth and product development.</p>

<h3 id="3-culturestride-universe">3. Culturestride Universe</h3>

<p>When I was actively learning Chinese, I always struggled to find great TV shows and movies that I could watch to help me bring up my listening and reading skills. I would rely on recommendations from Chinese friends that I’d hurriedly jot down and would never really be looked up afterwards (sorry!).</p>

<p>So we launched <a href="https://culturestride.com/universe" target="_blank">Culturestride Universe</a>.</p>

<p>Culturestride Universe is a community-driven repo of the best of Chinese entertainment and pop culture for students and anyone interested in immersing themselves deeper into Chinese culture.</p>

<p>We started with movies, TV Shows and anime as a pilot but we’d love to hear your suggestions on what you’d like to see next.</p>
